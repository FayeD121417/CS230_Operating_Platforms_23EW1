# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted a web-based application and wanted players to be able to create and join teams with unique identifiers.  A verification process was required to ensure each name that was created was available. The client was Creative Technology Solutions (CTS).

# What did you do particularly well in developing this document?
I think I did well at summarizing the requirements and identifying what the requirements were needed for the software application.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a design document was like having a summarized list of what needed to be addressed and included.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the table that compares Mac, Windows, Mobile Devices, and Linux because I don't like the format and it was difficult to edit.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I ensured that there was a validation process for checking to see if the names of players and teams were available for the user.  The software is created for the user, so not taking their needs into consideration is not an option.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
